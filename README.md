# mern-stack-task

proyecto basado en el tutorial de fazt 
this app was created without the create-react-app tool

to start this App you have to run mongod in your command line(you have to have installed mongoDB),
then use "npm run serve" to start node server,
if you want to edit the code you have to run "npm run webpack" to start coding without problems 😁😁
